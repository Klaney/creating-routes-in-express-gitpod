# creating-routes-in-express-gitpod
Welcome to this simple tutorial on how to write a route in express.

# Install packages.
In your terminal, run `npm i` (just type and press enter) to install necessary packages.

# Challenge
Currently we have a test that you may run with `npm run test`, this test should and will fail.

My challenge to you, is to dig your way through documentation and create a route in the app, that will make this test pass!

Don't worry, I won't leave you hanging, here is a resource to read from!
